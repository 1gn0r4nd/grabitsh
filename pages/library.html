          <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-500">
            GRABIT.SH is a versatile tool designed to help you manage and analyze your Git repositories efficiently. Follow the steps below to gather detailed project information and generate a custom bash script:
          </p>
          <ol class="mt-6 list-decimal list-inside text-lg text-gray-500 space-y-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Download and Install:</strong> Download the GRABIT.SH binary from the official GitHub repository and move it to a directory in your PATH. Ensure it's executable:
              <pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded mt-2 text-sm">chmod +x grabitsh</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Run GRABIT.SH:</strong> Open your terminal, navigate to your desired Git repository, and run:
              <pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded mt-2 text-sm">./grabitsh --output clipboard</pre>
              This command copies the output to your clipboard for easy sharing.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Generate a Custom Script Using AI:</strong> Copy the output from GRABIT.SH and use the prompt below to generate a tailored bash script with AI (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.):

              <pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded mt-2 text-sm">
"Create an exhaustive, no-holds-barred bash script that will ruthlessly dissect ANY software project directory, regardless of language, framework, or structure. This script should:

Recursively capture and output the ENTIRE content of EVERY single file in the project, regardless of type or size.
Generate a complete, multi-level directory structure, going as deep as possible.
If it's a git repo, extract EVERYTHING - full commit history, all branches, tags, stashes, and remotes.
Identify and prioritize key project files (READMEs, configs, build scripts, etc.) but DO NOT ignore anything.
Parse and output ALL dependency information from ANY kind of dependency management file it finds.
Capture ALL environment variables and configurations, with a clear warning about sensitive data.
Provide extensive file statistics - types, sizes, permissions, creation/modification dates, line counts, etc.
Identify and fully output any script, task file, or executable regardless of language.
Capture and display the content of ALL log files, not just snippets.
Attempt to identify the project type and provide deep, relevant information based on common patterns and structures.
Search for and output any comments in code files, prioritizing TODO, FIXME, and similar tags.
If applicable, extract database schemas, migration scripts, and even sample data (with appropriate warnings).
Identify and output any API endpoints, routes, or interface definitions it can find.
Look for and display any testing or CI/CD configuration and scripts.
Search for any documentation files (beyond just README) and output their content.
Attempt to find and display any metrics, analytics, or monitoring configurations.

The script should be merciless in its thoroughness, adaptable to ANY project structure, and include robust error handling. The output should be so comprehensive that it borders on information overload. The goal is to extract EVERY POSSIBLE DETAIL about the project, ensuring that someone (or an AI) could potentially recreate the entire project structure, understand its full history, and implement new features or debug issues without needing a single extra bit of context.
This script should treat EVERY file as important and EVERY piece of information as potentially crucial. It should err on the side of producing too much information rather than too little.

[PASTE OUTPUT HERE]

Based on this output, create the most comprehensive and adaptable bash script possible to gather this level of detail for any project."</pre>
